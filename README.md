# Analysis of the Iris dataset.  
Neural networks with different activation functions cope well with the task of classification.  
It was found that for faster training of a neural network, it is advisable to use the activation function real, because with such a subchord, the number of epochs for training is 201. When using sigmoids as an activation function, it is necessary to increase the number of epochs by 400.  
The accuracy in both cases is approximately 87%
